Hello Fardad,

Hope you are doing well, as promised, I have created few slides for the analysis I was able to do. Also, apologies for replying so late at night, since retention was something I was not completely exposed to, I had to understand the concept thoroughly in terms of Groove Collaborative and gave a stab to perform the analysis. It was a very interesting analysis, since I got to figure out multiple things to just find out insights from the data. I really liked it. Thanks for sharing.

Just wanted you to know couple of aspects:

1. I have shared only two scripts, but I have uses, multiple functions like Joins, Window functions, date time manipulation and string conversions for order_value, so I think that should give a brief idea about my skills in SQL. Again was figuring out Big query alternatives for SQLITE which was very interesting.

2. I have tried to brief my analysis as best as I can in the slides, but the spreadsheet attached also has all the analysis, it's not the best spreadsheet since it has all my ground work but for your reference I have attached it, since that is where I have all ground work for the graphs and charts 

Here are the slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17efBHGnZzIRDV-Bou_O3h0fq3lZiQ7F-GwUlErpCGNE/edit#slide=id.g5c1753338a_0_77
Spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PXyqyYlecv5RVkzsajqojqhSH79ak7K1TX8GXgq7qSo/edit#gid=1137483304
Also please let me know if the google sheets are not the best way to convey the results I will download the sheets into pptx and xlxs format if required.
Looking forward to hearing you feedback and insights.
